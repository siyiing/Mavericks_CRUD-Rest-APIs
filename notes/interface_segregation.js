// to make interface smaller and more concise

// what interface does it that, for whatever class that implements interface, the class must use all the portion in the interface 
// e.g. interface entity have move, attack and takeDamage
// Character have all those but Turret does not have thus cannot work 

// thus to fix it, we should use class and inheritance instead of using interface
